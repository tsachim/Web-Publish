    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="content"><img class="main-image" src="pics/type_of_fish.png" alt="Fish" title="Fish" height="400px"></div>
    <p>Fish are a diverse group of aquatic animals that play vital roles in ecosystems, food chains, and human culture.<br>
        They are vertebrates characterized by gills, fins, and typically live in water throughout their life.<br>
        With over 34,000 known species, fish are the most diverse group of vertebrates.</p>

  <section id="classification">
    <h2>Classification of Fish</h2>
    <p>Fish are broadly classified into three main categories:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bony Fish (Osteichthyes)</strong>: Represent over 90% of fish species. Includes species such as salmon and goldfish.</li>
      <li><strong>Cartilaginous Fish (Chondrichthyes)</strong>: Have skeletons made of cartilage rather than bone. Includes sharks and rays.</li>
      <li><strong>Jawless Fish (Agnatha)</strong>: Primitive fish with no jaws, such as lampreys and hagfish.</li>
    </ul>

  <section id="habitat">
    <h2>Fish Habitats</h2>
    <p>Fish inhabit nearly every aquatic environment on Earth, ranging from freshwater lakes and rivers to deep ocean trenches. Major habitat types include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Freshwater</strong>: Rivers, lakes, ponds (e.g., trout, catfish).</li>
      <li><strong>Saltwater</strong>: Oceans and seas (e.g., tuna, clownfish).</li>
      <li><strong>Brackish Water</strong>: Mixture of fresh and saltwater, such as estuaries (e.g., some species of tilapia).</li>
      <li><strong>Deep Sea</strong>: High pressure, no light (e.g., anglerfish, lanternfish).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Fish exhibit a variety of anatomical adaptations that support their survival in aquatic environments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operculum (gill cover)</strong>: A bony flap that covers and protects the gills. It opens and closes to allow water to flow over the gills, enabling respiration.</li>
      <li><strong>Pectoral fins (paired)</strong>: These are a pair of fins located on each side of the fish just behind the operculum. They help the fish steer, balance, and maintain position in the water.</li>
      <li><strong>Photophores</strong>: Light-emitting organs found in some fish, especially deep-sea species. They are used for camouflage, attracting prey, or communication.</li>
      <li><strong>Pelvic fins (paired)</strong>: These are located on the bottom of the fish, usually under the pectoral fins. They help in stabilizing the fish and controlling its movement up and down.</li>
      <li><strong>Lateral line system (sensory organ system)</strong>: A line of sensory organs that run along the sides of the fish. It detects vibrations and movements in the water, helping the fish sense its surroundings and other organisms.</li>
      <li><strong>Dorsal fin</strong>: A fin located on the back (top) of the fish. It helps keep the fish upright and prevents it from rolling over.</li>
      <li><strong>Fat fin</strong>: A small, fleshy fin found between the dorsal and caudal fins in some fish species. Its function is not entirely understood, but it may help with stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Anal fin</strong>: Located on the underside of the fish behind the pelvic fins. It helps to stabilize the fish while swimming.</li>
      <li><strong>Caudal peduncle</strong>: The narrow part of a fish's body that connects the main body to the caudal (tail) fin. It plays a role in the movement and flexibility of the tail.</li>
      <li><strong>Caudal fin (tail fin)</strong>: The tail fin provides propulsion, allowing the fish to move forward. It also helps in steering and speed control.</li>
